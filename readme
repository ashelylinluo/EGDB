Significance and Innovation
Pearl millet, the sixth most cultivated grain worldwide, is widely recognized for its resilience to heat and drought, making it an ideal model for studying crop adaptation in arid environments. Its genome and pangenome have been published in high-impact journals, highlighting its importance in both crop science and bioenergy research. Our study provides the first detailed epigenomic map for pearl millet, with 163 Gb of sequencing data covering nine chromatin features in leaf tissue. This map offers new insights into regulatory elements and transcriptional mechanisms, complementing the genome and pangenome resources currently available.

Highlights of this work are summarized as follows:

Comprehensive multi-omics integration for energy grasses: EGDB is a pioneering platform that consolidates genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and phenotypic data across major energy grass genera, including Cenchrus, Miscanthus, and Arundo. This addresses a significant gap in bioenergy research resources and supports comprehensive analyses of key bioenergy crops.

Detailed epigenomic map of pearl millet: Our work introduces an extensive epigenomic map for pearl millet, enabling systematic annotation of regulatory elements and providing unique insights into transcriptional regulation mechanisms.

Broad applications for bioenergy and environmental research: EGDB includes intuitive modules such as BLAST, BROWSER, SEARCH, and CRISPR Design, which facilitate gene functional analysis, regulatory element exploration, and efficient data retrieval for users across different research disciplines. EGDB serves as an invaluable resource for exploring regulatory mechanisms in energy grasses, supporting research on bioenergy crop improvement and ecological adaptation, which is essential in the context of sustainable energy and carbon capture efforts.
